Deployement:
1. import the customers table(customers.sql)
2. change the database configuration options in the testpage.php and the sub_page.php
3. enjoy :)

Use:

first of all you have to establish a database connection using mysqli or if you decide to use anything else
 just modify the database related method calls from the core class

The you instantiate the core class paginator passing to it:
1. page id
2. Records per page
3. SQL Query
4. MySQLi Connection Object

Then call method: paginate()

It does all the work and returns an associative array, else if you want to access the MySQLi result object
you can access it by using the object property called result(e.g. $paginator->result)


The getLinks Method returns a string that contains the actual html for the pagination links

You also have to use the same settings or the same code for the subpage also.

I hope this class is useful for you.
